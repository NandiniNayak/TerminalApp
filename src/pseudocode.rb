If user inputs invalid answer or input(error), they will be asked to try again(enter valid input). Once user has invoked 10 spells, user will be prompted "quit" to exit loop to main menu, or "retry" to restart loop and play again. User can input "help" to show a cheat sheet of Invoker's spells and combinations, and a description of how each game mode works. Invoker's abilities: (reminder to include R at the end to invoke spell) e.g. QQQR for COLD SNAP QQQ - COLD SNAP QQW - GHOST WALK QQE - ICE WALL WWW - E.M.P.

# --NICE TO HAVE FEATURES-- -limit of 3 character combinations when invoking spells, after 3 is reached, the 1st character is removed, and 2nd character entered becomes the first in line. e.g. EEE is the 3 character limit, if next input is W, EEW will be shown. R will become the invoke+enter to confirm user's input. e.g instead of QQQR then enter, if user inputs QQQ then R, R will be the confirmation, and enter/return key is not needed

# -unrestricted combination order. as long as the right letter combinations are in the input for the spell, the right spell will be invoked. e.g. QWE ("DEAFENING BLAST") will still be "DEAFENING BLAST" with the order of EWQ, EQW, WQE, WEQ, QEW. e.g. QQE ("ICE WALL") will still be "ICE WALL" with the order of QEQ, EQQ.

# -timer for how long user takes/is playing current game mode. timer can show average speed for spells being invoked, or possibilty of a countdown mode (e.g 30 seconds for user to invoke as many spells as they can).

# -scoring system to keep track of best runs, possible score penalty for wrong/invalid inputs

# -additional game modes in future

# -vs mode play against others to see who's the fastest
